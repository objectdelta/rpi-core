rpi-core
========

OS-Kernel for the RaspBerryPi.

For now this project is a "try-to-learn-low-level-coding" project, so the sourcecode is more or less a copy of the great examples made by David Welch (https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi) until i know the arm-assembler/arm-architectur and the raspberrypi itself.
